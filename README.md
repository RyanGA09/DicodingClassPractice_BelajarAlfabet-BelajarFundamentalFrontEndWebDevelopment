## Description

Dicoding Class Practice Learn the Alphabet is an application designed to help users, especially children, learn and recognize the alphabet letters in a fun and easy-to-understand way. This app not only provides an engaging visual display but also serves as a practical exercise for understanding the fundamentals of web development, specifically using layouting techniques with CSS Grid.

This project is part of the Learn Front-End Web Development Fundamentals course on Dicoding. In this exercise, users will focus on applying the CSS Grid technique to create a page layout that displays a collection of alphabet letters. By leveraging the responsive capabilities of CSS Grid, users will learn how to structure page elements in a more flexible and organized way, without needing to write complex code.

Additionally, this exercise helps users understand how to modify and adapt page designs to ensure they look great on a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile, using media queries.

Through this exercise, youâ€™ll not only create an educational app but also gain a deeper understanding of how CSS Grid works and how to apply it to real-world projects.
