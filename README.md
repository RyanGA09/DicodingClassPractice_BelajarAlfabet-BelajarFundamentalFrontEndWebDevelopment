## Description

Dicoding Class Practice Learn the Alphabet is an application designed to help users, especially children, learn and recognize the alphabet letters in a fun and easy-to-understand way. This app not only provides an engaging visual display but also serves as a practical exercise for understanding the fundamentals of web development, specifically using layouting techniques with CSS Grid.

This project is part of the Learn Front-End Web Development Fundamentals course on Dicoding. In this exercise, users will focus on applying the CSS Grid technique to create a page layout that displays a collection of alphabet letters. By leveraging the responsive capabilities of CSS Grid, users will learn how to structure page elements in a more flexible and organized way, without needing to write complex code.

Additionally, this exercise helps users understand how to modify and adapt page designs to ensure they look great on a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile, using media queries.

Through this exercise, youâ€™ll not only create an educational app but also gain a deeper understanding of how CSS Grid works and how to apply it to real-world projects.

## Objective

The purpose of this exercise is to provide a better understanding of how to use CSS Grid in a front-end project. By building the Learn the Alphabet page, users will learn how to arrange page elements responsively and dynamically using CSS Grid, which is an essential skill in modern web development.

Furthermore, this exercise will also give users the opportunity to:

- Understand the differences between Flexbox and CSS Grid in layout design.
- Learn how to use media queries for responsive design.
- Create a layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

Ultimately, this exercise will provide hands-on experience in building a web app that is not only enjoyable to use but also efficient in terms of styling and performance.
